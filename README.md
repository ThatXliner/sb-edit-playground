# sb-edit-playground

## setup

just clone, npm install, and link (your-dir-to-scratch-js)/scratch-js (the directory that contains the mjs files) to sb-edit-playground/scratch-js if you plan on testing scratch-js with this! you'll probably want to mess with index.js to adjust it to your liking, i haven't coded it to be full-featured without editing that file yet
